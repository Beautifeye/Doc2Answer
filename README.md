# Doc2Answer
Doc2Answer is an Italian Visual Document Understanding model that nails any document layout.

The model has been proposed as Challenge Solution for one of the AI4EU Open Calls.

Doc2Answer is a transformers-based model designed to tackle Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks. The model will extract valuable knowledge from the image and auto-fill generated or manually specified data fields which can vary from document to document. The problem will be approached as a Visual Q&A task. Given an input image, it will be possible for the model to address any questions and fill the related data fields accordingly. Leveraging the latest breakthrough technologies in the fields of CV and NLP, the architecture will deliver a robust solution beyond the detection of single words, and with a comprehension of the broader context of the document.
